## Appendix: Templates & Resources

### A. Launch Announcement Template

**Title:** "Introducing ELAUAOMS: Universal Memory for ElevenLabs Voice Agents"

**Body:**
```
Hey everyone! 👋

I built ELAUAOMS to solve a problem I kept running into: adding memory to ElevenLabs agents was either expensive (hosted services) or time-consuming (building from scratch).

ELAUAOMS is a plug-and-play memory system that:
- ✅ Works with any ElevenLabs agent
- ✅ Costs ~$0.026 per call (vs $0.15-0.50)
- ✅ Takes 15 minutes to deploy
- ✅ Self-hosted (your data stays yours)
- ✅ Open source (MIT license)

[Link to demo video]

The system automatically:
- Extracts memories from conversations
- Personalizes greetings for returning callers
- Enables during-call memory search
- Shares memories across your agents

I'd love your feedback! GitHub: [link]

Happy to answer any questions in the comments.

**Subject:** "Integration opportunity: Memory system for ElevenLabs"

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

I'm [Your Name], creator of ELAUAOMS—an open-source memory system for ElevenLabs voice agents.

We've been getting traction with developers who also use [Partner Product], and I see an opportunity for an official integration that would benefit both communities.

ELAUAOMS: [2-sentence description]
Current traction: [X stars, Y deployments]

Would you be open to a quick call to explore a partnership? I'm thinking:
- Pre-built integration template
- Co-authored blog post
- Cross-promotion to both audiences

Let me know if you're interested!

Best,
[Your Name]
